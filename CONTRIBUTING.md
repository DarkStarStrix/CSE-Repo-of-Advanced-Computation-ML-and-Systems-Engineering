#  CONTRIBUTING TO CSE++ JOURNAL

Welcome to the CSE++ Journal of Advanced Computation, Machine Learning, and Systems Engineering. This is not a traditional journal. We operate as an open, community-driven, radically transparent platform to publish high-integrity, high-rigor scientific and technical research.

Whether you're a solo researcher, an industry engineer, or an academic, if your work is robust, well-documented, and intellectually honest, **you are welcome here**.

## Philosophy

The journal is built on four immovable pillars:

### 1.  **Merit**
We care only about the quality of your work—not your institution, affiliation, or location. If your work contributes to scientific or engineering progress, it deserves to be shared and preserved.

### 2. **Radical Transparency**
All submissions must include:
- Full manuscript (1-column PDF, LaTeX preferred)
- All associated code, data, and configuration files
- A `methodology.md` describing the experimental setup
- Complete metadata (`.yaml`) for indexing and DOI generation

This enables full reproducibility, auditability, and trust in your results.

### 3. **Integrity**
Plagiarism, falsified results, synthetic benchmarks, or misrepresented methodology will not be tolerated. Every contribution is subject to public peer review by domain experts in the repository.

### 4.  **Zero Tolerance for Misconduct**
We have a clearly enforced **three-strike system** (see below).

## Contribution Process

1. **Fork the repository**.
2. Create a branch under `submissions/your-name-paper-title/`.
3. Add:
   - `paper.pdf`
   - `code/` directory (scripts, models, notebooks)
   - `plots/` directory (figures used in the paper)
   - `methodology.md`
   - `metadata.yaml`
4. Submit a pull request (PR).
5. The community and editors will provide feedback via PR comments.
6. You may revise based on suggestions.
7. Once accepted, your work is merged, assigned a DOI, and archived permanently.

## Integrity Enforcement & Strike System

We are firm believers in academic freedom—but even firmer believers in **accountability**.

### Three-Strike Policy:
- **Strike 1**: Substantive error, misleading claim, or poor documentation. You’ll be asked to revise and explain.
- **Strike 2**: Repeated failure to respond to feedback, falsified elements, or unacknowledged derivations.
- **Strike 3**: Proven academic dishonesty, toxicity in peer review, or evasion of accountability.

Three strikes = permanent ban from submission or participation in the journal.

## Peer Review Standards

Submissions will be evaluated based on:

1. **Technical Quality**: Is the work sound, replicable, and correctly implemented?
2. **Clarity**: Can others understand your contribution and how you achieved it?
3. **Novelty/Utility**: Does it introduce new insights, methods, benchmarks, or tools?

Peer reviewers are drawn from the contributor pool and selected for domain alignment.

##  Final Notes

This journal is built by researchers for researchers. It is independent, decentralized, and committed to pushing science forward.

By contributing, you are joining a movement. Let’s build the scientific future we want to live in—one of freedom, rigor, and collective brilliance.

**Science should belong to everyone.**

Photometric Features: Magnitudes in five bands (u, g, r, i, z). Spectroscopic Features: redshift, plate, MJD (Modified Julian Date). Positional Features: alpha (right ascension), delta (declination). Metadata: obj_ID, run_ID, rerun_ID, cam_col, field_ID, spec_obj_ID, fiber_ID. GALAXY: 59.45% STAR: 21.59% QSO: 18.96% Outlier Removal: Identified and excluded outliers using IQR, where values below Q1- 1.5 \\times IQR or above Q3 + 1.5 \\times IQR were dropped. Feature Engineering: Generated five interaction terms (redshift_u, redshift_g, Standardization: Scaled features to facilitate convergence in distance-based (KNN) SMOTE: Balanced the training set to mitigate bias toward the majority class(GALAXY). Hyperparameters: Tuned n_neighbors (options: 3, 5, 7, 10) using Rationale: Captures local patterns effectively with minimal assumptions. Hyperparameters: Determined optimal components (110) using Bayesian Rationale: Provides unsupervised clustering to explore data structure, Hyperparameters: Tuned depth (4, 6, 8), learning_rate (0.01, 0.05, 0.1), Implementation: Utilized GPU acceleration for efficiency. Rationale: Handles categorical features and provides robust gradient Architecture: Input layer (size: features + 3 CatBoost probabilities), hidden Training: Used Adam optimizer, cross-entropy loss, and early stopping(patience=5) based on validation loss. Rationale: Captures complex, non-linear relationships. Input: Stacked probability outputs from KNN, CatBoost, and Neural Network. Rationale: Combines diverse model predictions to enhance overall Accuracy: Proportion of correct predictions. Precision (Macro-Averaged): Average precision across classes, emphasizing Recall (Macro-Averaged): Average recall across classes. F1-Score (Macro-Averaged): Harmonic mean of precision and recall. Confusion Matrix: Detailed breakdown of true vs. predicted labels. Adjusted Rand Index (ARI): For GMM, measuring cluster-label similarity. GALAXY: All models classify GALAXY instances with high accuracy (above 96%), QSO: The QSO class, the smallest in the original dataset (18.96%), benefits most STAR: All models achieve near-perfect accuracy for STAR, with misclassifications CatBoost: Permutation importance (Figure 3 placeholder) identifies redshift, r, i, Neural Network: SHAP values (Figure 4 placeholder) emphasize CatBoost Training: KNN requires minimal computation (seconds on a CPU), while CatBoost(10 minutes with GPU) and the Neural Network (10 minutes with GPU) are more Inference: All models, including the Meta-Learner, perform inference on the test set(17,000 instances) in seconds, making the approach viable for large-scale(97.37%) and balanced precision, recall, and F1-score (0.95, 0.96, 0.96).
